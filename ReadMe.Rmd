This is the repository for the Shiny app MeasureUp that was created for the
Data Products course of Coursera.

The two files for the app itself are ui.R and server.R.

The folder shinyapps was created by publishing the app to the RStudio server 
(https://jerrynedelman.shinyapps.io/MeasureUp/).

The file MeasureUp.Rpres is an RStudio Presenter file describing the app, 
and the other MeasureUp* files are associated with it and its
publication on Rpubs (http://www.rpubs.com/nedelje1/59565).
